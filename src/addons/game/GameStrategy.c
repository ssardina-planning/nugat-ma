  Synopsis    [ A structure which can store a strategy for a player. ]

  Description [ A strategy defines how the player to whom the strategy
                applies should behave (usually, but not necessarily,
                to win a game).

                The main elements of a strategy are the following 6
                BDDs: init_goal, init_opponent_deadlock, init_moves,
                goal, opponent_deadlock, moves.

                Three BDDs describe how to move in the player\'s very
                first move of the game (init_goal,
                init_opponent_deadlock, and init_moves}) and the three
                others how to continue the game from the player\'s
                second move onwards (goal, opponent_deadlock, and
                moves}).

                Two BDDs state whether a goal state has just been
                reached or how it can be reached (init_goal, goal).
                Two BDDs state how a deadlock of the opponent can be
                enforced (init_opponent_deadlock,
                opponent_deadlock). In both previous cases the game
                either has been won or will be won after performing
                one of the moves contained. The remaining two BDDs
                (init_moves, moves) list moves that (in case of a
                winning strategy) ensure ultimately winning the game,
                but possibly not immediately.

                Depending on the

                - initial condition (N(+1), A(+1), E(+1)),

                - the player (PLAYER_1, PLAYER_2), and

                - the kind of move ((init_)goal,
                  (init_)opponent_deadlock, (init_)moves)

                the variables over which the BDDs are defined can be
                partitioned into two sets, called "condition
                variables" C (renamed from the historical, but
                possibly confusing, "state variables") and "action
                variables" A.

                Given this partition of variables, an assignment x
                making one of the BDDs true is understood as follows
                (where |_ denotes existential projection): if x|_C is
                true, then carry out the assignment x|_A.

                Two special cases are C={} ({} denotes the empty set)
                and A={}. The case C={} is straightforward in that the
                corresponding move may be carried out
                unconditionally. An example is init_moves when player
                = PLAYER_1 and the initial condition is N(+1): there
                is no previous/partial state over which a condition
                could be formulated. The case A={} merely recognizes
                truth of some condition (such as being a goal state)
                but does not necessitate an action. An example here is
                goal when player = PLAYER_1 and the initial condition
                is N(+1): The previous move of PLAYER_2 took the game
                into a goal state and PLAYER_1 has won without any
                further action.

                Below the partition into C and A is explained. p1 and
                p2 stand for current state variables of PLAYER_1 and
                PLAYER_2, next(p1) and next(p2) for next state
                variables of PLAYER_1 and PLAYER_2. + denotes set
                union.

                ======================================================
                init_goal
                ======================================================
                N,N+1

                PLAYER_1: C = {}, A = p1
                          Player 1 only recognizes having won once a
                          goal state has been reached. Hence,
                          init_goal is always false here.

                PLAYER_2: C = p1, A = p2
                          Depending on the choices of player 1, the
                          moves of player 2 that directly reach a goal
                          state.
                ------------------------------------------------------
                A,E+1:    C = p1 + p2, A = {}
                          Here a strategy needs to cover each initial
                          state (the opponent can pick (legal) values
                          for both player 1 and player 2 variables in
                          the initial state). Hence, the player cannot
                          decide which move to make and the variables
                          are only partitioned in order to allow
                          recognition of whether the game already ends
                          after the initial moves or not (here: is in
                          a goal state).
                ------------------------------------------------------
                E,A+1:    C = {}, A = p1 + p2
                          Here a strategy needs to cover only a single
                          initial state (the player can pick (legal)
                          values for both player 1 and player 2
                          variables in the initial state). Hence, both
                          player 1 and player 2 variables are action
                          variables. The partitioning allows
                          recognition of which moves end the game
                          already after the initial moves (here: is in
                          a goal state).
                ======================================================

                ======================================================
                init_opponent_deadlock
                ======================================================
                N,N+1

                PLAYER_1: C = {}, A = p1
                          The moves of player 1 that s.t. subsequently
                          player 2 has no legal move.

                PLAYER_2: C = p1, A = p2
                          Depending on the choices of player 1, the
                          moves of player 2 s.t. player 1 subsequently
                          has no legal move.
                ------------------------------------------------------
                A,E+1

                PLAYER_1: C = p1 + p2, A = {}
                          The strategy needs to be valid only for
                          combinations of legal player 1 and player 2
                          initial states. Hence, a player 1 initial
                          state that is a deadlock for player 2 does
                          not need to be covered and, therefore,
                          init_opponent_deadlock is always false here.

                PLAYER_2: C = p1 + p2, A = {}
                          Analogous to init_goal.
                ------------------------------------------------------
                E,A+1

                PLAYER_1: C = {}, A = p1 + p2
                          The strategy needs to be valid for some
                          combination of legal player 1 and player 2
                          initial states. Hence, a player 1 initial
                          state that is a deadlock for player 2 makes
                          no sense and, therefore,
                          init_opponent_deadlock is always false here.

                PLAYER_2: C = {}, A = p1 + p2
                          Analogous to init_goal.

                          the strategy, let him win (but not
                          necessarily right after this move).

                PLAYER_2: C = p1, A = p2
                          Depending on the choices of player 1, the

                          player 1 has just won the game without
                          making any further move.

  Synopsis    [ Constructor for class GameStrategy ]

  Description [ This constructor is designed to be used after having
                checked a game property.

                player - is the player the game was played for.

                reverseInitialQuantifiers - is a flag that the
                  strategy is computed for the opponent and it is
                  necessary to change quantifiers to the opposite
                  values.

                goal - a set of goal states (if they are reached a
                  game is considered winning).

                winningStates - is the set of all the states the game
                  can be won from (including opponent deadlocks).

                trans - is the set of transitions which allow the
                  player to win the game.

                Note: both winningStates and trans can be zero Bdd if
                game is won with the help of initial conditions only
                (i.e. the opponent initial condition is zero).

                Caller retains ownership of all arguments. ]

  Synopsis    [ Prints the strategy generated by game specification

  Description [ Builds and prints a strategy module for a game
                problem. The newly created strategy module will be
                called "STRATEGY_MODULE n", being n a unique
                auto-incremented natural number.

                'vars' contains the variables for printing. Its subset
                vars_to_decls contains variables for the strategy that
                need to be declared. Caller retains ownership of both
                lists.

                If the initial condition of the game is N(+1), then
                the resulting strategy module can be simply put in
                parallel with the corresponding player. However, if
                the initial condition is A(+1) or E(+1) and the player
                is PLAYER_1, then the initial condition might also
                contain player 2 variables. In that case (and also in
                the case N(+1)) the strategy module can be used as
                follows:
                - Turn the game into a standard NuSMV module by
                  merging both players.
                - Form the synchronous product of that module and the
                  strategy module.
                Now one can, e.g., perform simulation or verification. ]
